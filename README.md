# Introduction to SQL

Textbook and course material, for the Introduction to SQL course, taught by [Daniel Fryer](https://danielvfryer.com).

This repository includes slides for the full 4 day course. Those attending the 2 day course will notice small differences in the slides when we get started.

## Set up guides

For this course, you need to choose between T-SQL and MySQL. If you don't know which one you want, then consider this: if you are on Windows, T-SQL is the easiest to set up and use. If you are on macOS, then MySQL is the easiest to set up and use. Please do not leave the set up process to the last minute. Leave some time to iron out difficulties getting set up! Feel free to contact me if you need help. The guides below will help you get set up.

* **Set up your database with T-SQL (easiest for Windows):** [click here](create-database/T-SQL/README.md)
* **Set up your database with MySQL (easiest for macOS):** [click here](create-database/MySQL/README.md)

## Beginner R tutorial

For beginner R programmers, day 4 may move a bit fast. This tutorial (by [SwirlStats](https://swirlstats.com/students.html)) will help you get prepared (or brush up). Right-click (or control-click) the link below, and choose 'save link as'. This will download the R script. Once downloaded, open the script in RStudio.

If this is the first time you've used RStudio, I've created a video for you to guide you through using the above script.

To be fully prepared for day 4, I suggest you complete all lessons from Lesson 1 (Basic Building Blocks), to Lesson 9 (Functions), of the Intro to R course, within the Swirl tutorial. You will see these lessons when you start the Swirl tutorial (also explained in the video linked above). I suspect this will take about 1 hour.
