Notes and course material will be uploaded here, for the Introduction to SQL course, taught by [Daniel Fryer](https://danielvfryer.com).

The next delivery is:

* Nov 18-19, 2021, for the [New Zealand Social Statistics Network](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/arts/our-research/research-institutes-centres-groups/compass/nzssn/introduction-to-sql.html)

## Set up guides

For this course, you need to choose between T-SQL and MySQL. If you don't know which one you want, then consider this: if you are on Windows, T-SQL is the easiest to set up and use. If you are on macOS, then MySQL is the easiest to set up and use. If you are on macOS and you really want to use T-SQL, then please do not leave the set up process to the last minute. You must try to get set up before the course. Contact me if you need help. The guides below will help you get set up.
