## Should you use SQL Fiddle?

Many of the exercises in this course can be completed through a browser using [sqlfiddle.com](http://sqlfiddle.com/).

The drawbacks are that you can't work with multiple schemas and databases at the same time, and you need to build each schema as you use it.

The advantage is that you can use SQL Fiddle from any browser with installation steps.

## Using SQL Fiddle

Navigate to [sqlfiddle.com](http://sqlfiddle.com/), select MS SQL Server 2017 from the drop-down menu at the top left of the page, and then build a schema by copying the schema code (linked below) into the schema panel then pressing 'build schema'.

Here are links to the schema code for the exercises:

* [Notes schema](T-SQL-notes-schema.sql) 
* [Ape schema](T-SQL-ape-schema.sql)
* [Analytics schema](T-SQL-analytics-schema.sql)
