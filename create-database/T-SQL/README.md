## Windows — Install **SQL Server Developer Edition**

> 🧰 **Before you start:**
> Install **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
> We'll use VS Code to connect to SQL Server later in the course.

**SQL Server Developer Edition** is free, full-featured, and perfect for learning.

1. Go to
   👉 [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
2. Under **SQL Server 2022 Developer**, click **Download now**.
3. Run the installer and choose **Basic** setup (quickest).
4. When installation finishes, note the **server name** (usually `localhost` or `localhost\SQLEXPRESS`).
5. If you like, you can install **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** from the same page – this gives you an additional GUI to browse tables and run/administer SQL.

✅ *Optional:* In Visual Studio Code, install the [**SQL Server (MSSQL)**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql) extension. We can install this during the course, but if you can get it done beforehand 
then it gives us time to resolve any hiccups! [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlyQ9GR1LBM) on how to 
install extensions in VS Code.
