## Beginner R tutorial

R is covered in 4-day course, though we may have time for some R material during the 2-day course, depending on the audience. For beginner R programmers, day 4 may move a bit fast. This tutorial (by [SwirlStats](https://swirlstats.com/students.html)) will help you get prepared (or brush up). Right-click (or control-click) the link below, and choose 'save link as'. This will download the R script. Once downloaded, open the script in RStudio.

If this is the first time you've used RStudio, I've created a video for you to guide you through using the above script.

To be fully prepared for day 4, I suggest you complete all lessons from Lesson 1 (Basic Building Blocks), to Lesson 9 (Functions), of the Intro to R course, within the Swirl tutorial. You will see these lessons when you start the Swirl tutorial (also explained in the video linked above). I suspect this will take about 1 hour.
