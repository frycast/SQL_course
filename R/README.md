# This folder contains scripts and guides related to R

### Beginners

For beginners, I've prepared the below zip file containing four scripts for you to run through in order (0,1,2,3). These four scripts contain the major takeaways from day 4.

* [(zip file) beginner scripts](beginners.zip)

### Connecting remotely

The above-mentioned beginner scripts create a SQLite connection object (which we call `con`). You can also create connection objects to remove or local MySQL or T-SQL servers. The guide below will show you how to do that. The connection objects you create can be used in exactly the same ways demontrated in the beginner scripts `con`.
